### Arduino flow sensor FS300A

Repo it's part of students project. Project aims to prototype system (gas mask like) enabling the measurement of energy consumption while performing various physical activities. Based on the relationship between ventilation and oxygen consumption, you can calculate the approximate value of energy expenditure using the Datta-Ramanathan equation.

Repo contains implementation of Arduino UNO based controller for flow sensor FS300A.
